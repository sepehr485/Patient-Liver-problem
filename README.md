# Patients-Survival-Prediction


A hospital has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals.

The goal here is to develop a machine learning model that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment. In this excersise we are using different ML models such as logisticregression, Decision Tree,Random Forest,XGboost to find the best performance.
